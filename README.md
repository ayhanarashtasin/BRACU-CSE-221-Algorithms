# CSE 221: Algorithm Lab Repository

This repository contains lab assignments covering fundamental algorithmic concepts in CSE 221 at BRAC University. Each lab focuses on a specific algorithmic technique and problem-solving strategies.

## Lab Topics

1. **Sorting** (Total Questions: 7)  
   - Covers fundamental sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
   
2. **Two Pointer, Greedy** (Total Questions: 19)  
   - Implements efficient algorithms using the Two Pointer technique and Greedy approach for optimization problems.

3. **Divide and Conquer** (Total Questions: 10)  
   - Demonstrates problem-solving using the Divide and Conquer paradigm, including algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

4. **Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS) and Their Applications** (Total Questions: 11)  
   - Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for solving graph-related problems.

5. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (Total Questions: 11)  
   - Focuses on shortest path problems using Dijkstra’s Algorithm with priority queues.

6. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) & Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**  
   - Covers Union-Find data structure and Kruskal’s/Prim’s algorithms for finding MST.

7. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
   - Solves optimization problems using dynamic programming techniques like memoization and tabulation.
